# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: None

Description:
I could not find any vulnerability with blue I tried a session hijack by making note of the session ID and changing it with the provided tool, but couldnt get access on the 
attacker side. I also tried injecting SQL into the username and password fields, which was also unsuccessful. Both the username and password fields filter it out.


## Green

Vulnerability #1: User Enumeration
Description: When using the provided username "jmonroe99", the incorrect password is flagged with bold case letters, any non valid username uses standard case.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR
Description: When accessing individual salespersons pages from the site, changing the id in the URL allows to view other users who arent on the list.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work
I had quite a bit of difficulty with blue. Since I knew that green and Red had UE and IDOR respectively, I didnt need to worry about testing that on blue. I couldn't find
anything in the end.
